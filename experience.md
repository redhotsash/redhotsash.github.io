## Internship
- Worked at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), in the Office of Systems Architecture and Advanced Planning (OSAAP). Worked with OSAAP employees and took courses in order to learn how to use Tableau software and expand my knowledge of the coding language R. Planned, constructed, and presented an interactive Tableau dashboard that displays and processes data from surveys collected by employees at OSAAP. Registered for two national conferences where I presented my dashboard and findings in early 2022.
